# Git Hooked

This repository is meant to be a companion to a blog post (that is yet to be published).

There is a branch for each option of managing Git hooks:

* Using [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky/tree/master)
* Using a local `.hooks` directory and symlinks
* Using a local `.hooks` directory and Git configurations
